> This example builds a random tree using the Reingold-Tilford "tidy" algorithm, as described in "Tidier Drawings of Trees" and implemented by d3.layout.tree. As each node is added to the graph, it enters from the previous position of the parent node. Thus, the existing nodes and the new node transition smoothly to their new positions. The animation stops when 500 nodes have been added to the tree.
